# Regression
## What is regression? 
#### Regression is a technique for investigating the relationship between independent variables or features and a dependent variable or outcome. It's used as a method for predictive modelling in machine learning, in which an algorithm is used to predict continuous outcomes.
## Regression Analysis in Machine learning
#### Regression analysis is a statistical method to model the relationship between a dependent (target) and independent (predictor) variables with one or more independent variables. More specifically, Regression analysis helps us to understand how the value of the dependent variable is changing corresponding to an independent variable when other independent variables are held fixed. It predicts continuous/real values such as temperature, age, salary, price, etc.

## Types of Regression
#### There are various types of regressions which are used in data science and machine learning. Each type has its own importance on different scenarios, but at the core, all the regression methods analyze the effect of the independent variable on dependent variables. Here we are discussing some important types of regression which are given below:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Support Vector Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
